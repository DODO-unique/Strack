This is a project that would use an API server and a SQL database to provide API-curated infnormation to Desktop Widget (Windows only until demanded otherwise) and Mobile widget (through PWA)

Architecture and deeper planning would be pushed by 16/7/2025. Extra notes would be taken in voice recordings to save time; notes would be transcripted into markdowns by the end of the project
