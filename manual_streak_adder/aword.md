I would like to talk about `parseInt()` in [script.js](script.js):
This only reads the inital integers, otherwise it gives an error.

Suppose you go: parseInt('123ğŸ”¥'), this reads 123 fine.
if you go parseInt('ğŸ”¥123'), this does not work
if you go parseInt('12ğŸ”¥3'), this would only work with 12
